Then you have to configure the amount of hardware you want to use for the VM. I chose 4 cpu cores and 8gb of ram because my computer has the resources to allow me to do so and I prefer to have fast snappy VMs: <br/>

Now you have to create a virtual hard disk. I don't plan on storing a lot of data on this VM if at all so i'm going to stick to the default:  <br/>
